This Java program implements a simple quiz application using Swing for the GUI. The main features are:

Login Screen: Users enter their name and registration ID to start.
Welcome Screen: Displays a welcome message before the quiz begins.
Quiz Screen: Shows multiple-choice questions (with four options each), a timer (2 minutes for the whole quiz), and a "Next" button to proceed.
Quiz Logic: Tracks the current question, checks answers, updates the score, and moves to the next question.
Timer: Counts down; if time runs out, the quiz ends automatically.
Result Dialog: Shows the final score and offers to restart or exit.
The code uses a CardLayout to switch between screens and manages quiz data with arrays for questions, options, and correct answers.
